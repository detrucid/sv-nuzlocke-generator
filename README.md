# Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Nuzlocke Encounter Generator
Use this project to generate random encounters for a selected route.

Based on use and other user feedback, it appears this originally used data from Serebii, resulting in some false positives as well as a very high number of missed positives that tend not to be so obvious.
Bulbapedia is presently more accurate, so the encounter tables have been updated to match.
~~Currently 100% random, will consider the rareness of an encounter once the probability of encountering a pokemon on a given route is known.~~ I like the randomness and honestly, cannot code, so will never address this. Feel free to fork this.
